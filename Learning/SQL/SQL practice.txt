--MANIPULATION

*# Make a table called people, with 3 columns:
id (int)
name (str)
age (int)

*# Add a row to the table with someone's id, name, and age. Make their age wrong.

*# Grab everything currently in people

*# Add 3 more people

*# Grab all the names

*# Update whatever row contains the first ID to a new age

*# Add a new text column from the table called height
	(This will default to all NULL values at first)

*# Update whatever row contains the 4th ID to be given a height

*# Delete all rows that have NULL values in the height column

*# Make a new table called awards. Columns are id (int, primary key), recipient (string, cant be null), award_name (string, has a default award of "Grammy")
